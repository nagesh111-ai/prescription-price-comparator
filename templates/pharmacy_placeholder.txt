Important: 

A placeholder image for pharmacies should be added at:
/static/images/pharmacy-default.png

This file needs to be created manually by adding a generic pharmacy or medicine icon image.
The recommended size is 100x100 pixels.

You can find free icons at:
- Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/
- Flaticon: https://www.flaticon.com/
- Icons8: https://icons8.com/

Until you add this image, you might see broken image icons in the pharmacy comparison results.
